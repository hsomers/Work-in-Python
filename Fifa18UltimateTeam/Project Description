In this file, I am analyzing data associated with EA Sports' video game, Fifa 18. More specifically, I am analyzing the players from the
Ultimate Team game mode to figure out what the best-possible 11-player team could be.

The analysis is still a work in progress. I would like to incorporate the "team chemistry" aspect of ultimate team, which would require
some calculations based on nationality, position, and league that each player is in.
